<h1>Interactive Cyber-Physical System Hacking: Engaging Students Early Using Scalextric</h1>

<h1><h1>By Teja Pravallika </h1></h1>

  <h2>Abstract:</h2>
  <p>
Cyber Security as an education discipline covers a  variety  of  topics  that  can  be  challenging  and  complex  for  students who are new to the subject domain. With this in mind, it is crucial that new students are motivated by understanding both  the  technical  aspects  of  computing  and  networking,  and  the real-world implications of compromising these systems. In this paper we approach this task to create an engaging outreach experience,  on  the  concept  of  cyber-physical  systems,  using  a  Scalextric  slot-car  racetrack.  In  the  activity,  students  seek  to  compromise the underlying computer system that is linked to the track and updates the scoreboard system, in order to inflate their   own   score   and   to   sabotage   their   opponent.   Our   investigation   with   this   technique   shows   high   levels   of   engagement whilst providing an excellent platform for teaching basic  concepts  of  enumeration,  brute  forcing,  and  privilege  escalation.  It  also  provokes  discussion  on  how  this  activity  relates to real-world cases of cyber-physical systems security in the sports domain and beyond.</p>

  <h2>Introduction:</h2>
  <p>Since  the  formation  of  the  UK  Government  National  Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in 2016, a growing outreach community   has   developed   to   bring   together   schools,   industry,   and   academia,   engaging   young   people   with   computer  science  and  applied  cyber  security  skills  through  their  CyberFirst  programme  [1].  Across  the  wider  West  of  England  region,  Unlock  Cyber  is  a  regional  consortium,  supported    by    the    NCSC,    bringing    together    cyber    representatives    from    employers,    professional    bodies,    delivery partners, education providers and academia to raise awareness  of  cyber  security,  to  excite  and  engage  young  people  about  cyber,  and  to  showcase  the  opportunities  that  exist for young people on local and national levels [2]. Since 2018, Unlock Cyber have hosted an annual cyber taster day at  the  University  of  the  West  of  England,  attended  by  approximately   300   students   aged   between   12-14   from   schools across the West of England. The most recent event in June  2022  was  supported  by  12  industry  workshops  and  reached over 20 regional schools. Students rotated around a set of 40-minute workshops throughout the day, covering a variety  of  cyber  security  topics  such  as  Capture-The-Flag competitions,  a  digital  forensics  crime  scene  investigation,

  <h2>RELATED WORK:</h2>
  <p>We focus our review on the current trends and techniques for  cyber  security  education,  and  the  pedagogic  aspects  of  cyber  security.  There  exists  a  wealth  of  online  content  for  learning  about  cyber  security,  including  services  such  as  TryHackMe   [3]   and   HackTheBox   [4],   where   virtual   machines are deployed for experimentation and practice. One major  limitation  with  many  introductory  resources  is  the  abstract nature of cyber security -  students who are relatively new to the discipline may not grasp the impact of an attack on a virtual machine given this is an intangible asset. In terms of cyber-physical security, simulation training tools have also been developed, such as the Graphical Realistic Framework for  Industrial  Control  Systems  (GRFICS)  [5].  This  suite  of  tutorials   progresses   through   a   simulated   attack   on   the   Modbus  networking  protocol,  and  on  Programmable  Logic  Controllers (PLCs), resulting in the explosion of a chemical plant. Whilst this provides an excellent learning platform for understanding  various  concepts,  the  simulated  nature  may  still fail to capture the imagination of students compared to th at of a physical setup. In [6], we set out to overcome some of the limitations of simulation by linking home IoT devices to  an  online  CTF  submission  system  in  a  way  to  engage  students  remotely,  and  to  continue  our  outreach  activity  during  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  By  connecting  via  a  video  conferencing  platform,  students  could  complete  tasks  and  submit flags as per traditional methods, however they could then observe physical interactions such as turning devices on and   off,   through   to   controlling   a   robotic   vacuum   or   manipulating a light display, giving a sense of “hacking” the home IoT.Pencheva et al. [7] held discussion groups with teachers on  how  cyber  security  can  be  brought  into  classrooms,  and  around  student  engagement  when  teaching  cyber  security.  They conclude that students and parents need to be aware of the  range  of  opportunities  that  cyber  security  careers  can  bring,  and  teachers  need  to  be  supported  in  how  they  can  bring  practice-based  learning  to  the  classroom  in  a  manner  that they feel confident to run the class, whilst ensuring that practical   demonstrations   work   first   time   so   as   to   not   disengage students. Crick et al. [8] also highlight challenges related  to  university  teaching  of  Cyber  Security  within  the  UK. Similarly to other works, many of their challenges relate to  having  up-to -date  practice-based  learning  that  helps  to  enthuse  and  excite  students,  whilst  clearly  highlighting  the  relevance of this within the wider organisational and societal issues of cyber security.Our approach couples a hands-on practice-based exercise with  multiple  networked  systems,  including  a  scoreboard  system, and a motion sensor to provide connectivity with the physical   environment.   Working   in   teams,   students   can   immediately observe the consequences of their actions on the local  scoreboard,  thus  fostering  a  sense  of  competition.  Studies have shown [9] [10] that peer-based competition has a  constructive  effect  on  participation  and  learning  that  will  result  in  higher  learning  through  social  pressure  to  achieve  and better conceptual knowledge. </p>

  <h2>Activity:</h2>
  <p>The  premise  of  the  activity  itself  was  relatively  simple.  Students were told that they will be split into two teams who are competing to beat the other team’s score. Students were informed that they can increase their score using the cars and race track itself and given a rundown of the potential actions they   could   take   through   cyber   engagement,   such   as   increasing their own score or reducing their opponent team’s score.   After   a   brief   demonstration   of   the   sensors   and   scoreboard functionality by having the cars complete a lap of the racetrack, students were split into competing teams.The exercise was designed to walk students through the common  steps  of  any  CTF.  They  were  given  no  starting  information  about  the  network  other  than  to  know  that  all  devices required were connected to the same network. From there   (and   with   the   help   of   the   worksheets   and   /   or   supervisors) they would work through initial reconnaissance, first by finding their own IP address and then by mapping all active  IPs  (and  their  associated  services)  on  the  network  using NMap.Once  the  web  server  was  located,  the  students  moved  onto enumeration of the scoreboard page using DIRB. This would highlight four accessible pages:•admin -  Where they could easily reset the other teams score •test -  A “debugging” curl command that can be used to manually increase their score (by 1)•teams -  The target URI for increasing their own score•console -  The Python Werkzeug console, this could be used by teams to achieve a root reverse shellTeams  were  encouraged  to  visit  each  of  these  pages  to  explore  their  options,  with  the  ‘admin’  page  being  the  first  suggestion followed by the ‘test’ page. Once they had reset the opposing teams score and manually increased their own, they were encouraged to revisit some of the other available services  on  the  server.  Using  FTP  students  were  able  to  access  a  password  hash  in  the  download  directory,  whichwhen cracked using hashcat, would allow SSH access to the web server.With  terminal  access,  students  can  explore  the  user’s home  directory  and  find  a  .txt  file  that  contains  a  Python  script which automates the process of increasing the team’s score. For many teams this was the final stage of the exercise.It is also possible for teams to go through the system logs on  the  web  server  and  identify  a  debugging  pin  that  would  give  them  access  to  the  console  page.  From  there  a  simple  Python reverse shell would give root access to the web server where further actions on can be conducted, such as shutting down  the  web  server  at  a  point  where  one  team  had  more  points  than  the  other,  effectively  declaring  themselves  the  winners.  Other  possible  exploit  avenues  include  using  a  Metasploit   exploit   against   the   Werkzeug   console   or   analysing   the   local   network   traffic   using   Wireshark   to   determine the format of the POST request so that a manual curl command can be constructed to increment the lap count. This illustrates just some of the various methods that students may be able to uncover to gain access to the system.A.EngagementInitial   engagement   would   often   be   focused   on   the   physical   aspects   of   the   setup   (the   Scalextric   cars   and   racetrack), often with one or two students taking the lead and working  through  the  provided  cyber  activity  sheets,  with  assistance when required from those supervising the teams. By the end of the event usually 80-100% of the students were

  <h2>Conclusions:</h2>
  <p>In  this  paper  we  have  demonstrated  an  approach  for  a  self-c ontained active learning environment to create a novel teaching  experience  for  students.  We  combine  a  physical  Scalextric circuit as an initial hook to engage students, with a small local network containing two Raspberry Pis and two Kali  laptops.  Students  work  through  various  aspects  of  thecyber  kill  chain  to  compromise  the  scoreboard  and  modify  the   scores.   Early   feedback   from   students   and   teachers   suggests  that  this  is  an  engaging  and  exciting  outreach  activity  for  students,  and  the  packaged  activity  enables teachers,  with  support,  to  upskill,  own  and  run  their  own  similar  sessions.  Students  have  shown  creativity  in  their  attacks  against  the  system,  with  some  teams  performing  unexpected  attacks  such  as  performing  a  denial-of-service attack against the web server once their team were in front, or  even  using  physical  attacks  against  the  infrastructure  by  ripping pieces of paper from the worksheet and blocking the opposing team’s sensor.Future  work  will  explore  the  containerisation  of  the  application using Docker so that the environment can be reset without  the  need  to  reimage  the  SD  card.  By  restarting  the  container,   the   environment   will   be   reset   to   its   default   configuration,  thus  reducing  the  maintenance  complexities  and   overhead   of   having   to   burn   backup   SD   Cards. Furthermore,  we  will  explore  how  other  cyber  physical  systems  could  be  used  as  an  engagement  mechanism  in  a  similar fashion, such as Industrial Control Systems; and how the system can include actuation control from the Raspberry Pi  devices,  as  well  as  the  motion  sensing  capabilities,  allowing  for  a  greater  range  of  parameters  that  could  be  manipulated programmatically.The Raspberry Pi images and worksheets have been made available at http://go.uwe.ac.uk/scalextric.

<h2>Addendum:</h2>
<p>I made several stylistic choices while designing the layout and formatting of the HTML document. Here is an explanation of those choices:</p> 
<p><b>FontStyle Choices:</b>  I selected 'Verdana' and 'Cascadia Code Light' as the primary font families for the document. Verdana is a widely available sans-serif font that is easy to read, and Cascadia Code is a monospaced font designed for programming and source code editing. It is a variant of the Cascadia font family, which was developed by Microsoft and designed specifically to improve the readability of code.</p>
<p><b>Heading Sizes:</b> I chose different font sizes for the headings to establish a clear hierarchy and improve the visual structure of the content. The main heading ('h1') is set to 28px to make it prominent and easily noticeable, while the subheadings ('h2') are slightly smaller at 24px to provide a clear distinction between the different sections.</p>
<p><b>Main Text Size:</b> The main text ('p') is set to 18px with a line height of 1.6 to ensure readability and a comfortable reading experience. This size provides a balance between legibility and content density, making it easier for readers to go through the text without any strain.</p>
<p><b>Color Choices:</b>I added background color for the webpage as lavender. I used a combination of different colors for the headings and text to create visual contrast and improve the overall aesthetics of the document. The use of shades such as '#003366', '#990000', and '#800080' for the headings adds vibrancy and helps in drawing attention to important sections, while the use of '#333333', '#555555', and '#f9f9f9' for the text and backgrounds ensures readability and a pleasant visual experience.</p>
<p><b>Margin and Padding:</b> I included padding and margin for various elements to create sufficient spacing between the different sections and prevent the content from appearing cluttered. The padding of 20px for the body and articles, along with the margin-top of 20px for articles, helps in providing a well-defined structure and enhances the overall readability of the document.</p>
<p><b>Bold Text:</b> I used the 'b' tag to highlight certain text elements and make them bold, thereby emphasizing specific points and making them stand out within the content. This helps in drawing attention to important information and improving the overall readability of the document.</p>
